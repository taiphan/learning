## Collaboration

| Works With | Interaction |
|------------|-------------|
| **UI/UX Designer** | Collaborate on copy placement |
| **Frontend Developer** | Implement meta tags |
| **Project Manager** | Align on messaging |

---

## Agent continuity (mandatory)

Every persona session **must** use **`.agent/SESSION.md`** for cross-tool handoff. Follow **`.agents/skills/agent-continuity/SKILL.md`** and **`.agent/rules/agent-continuity.md`**.

### Session start (required)

1. If **`.agent/SESSION.md`** exists, **read it before** planning or editing code.
2. When the user says **continue**, **resume**, or **pick up**, run **`/resume`** (`.agents/workflows/resume.md`).
3. Read **`tasks/todo.md`** and linked spec paths from SESSION **Pointers**.

### During work (required)

- Update SESSION **In progress**, **Done**, and **Next** as meaningful progress happens — not only at session end.
- When **phase** or **persona** changes, update SESSION **Meta** (`phase`, `tool`, `persona`).
- Sync **`tasks/todo.md`** checkboxes when tasks change.
- **Never** store secrets or PII in SESSION — use paths, SHAs, and issue links.

### Session end (required)

- **Before ending** the session or switching tools/personas, update **`.agent/SESSION.md`** via **`/handoff`** (`.agents/workflows/handoff.md`).
- Do not leave stale **In progress** items; move finished work to **Done**.

---

## CodeGraph (mandatory)

Every persona **must** use **CodeGraph MCP** (`codegraph_*` tools) for structural code questions before grep/read loops or exploration sub-agents. Follow **`.agent/rules/codegraph.md`** and **`.agents/references/codegraph.md`**.

### When CodeGraph is required

Use `codegraph_*` for **structural** work — symbol lookup, callers/callees, traces, impact, and task-area context:

| Question | Tool |
|----------|------|
| Where is X defined? | `codegraph_search` |
| What calls / is called by Y? | `codegraph_callers` / `codegraph_callees` |
| How does X reach Y? | `codegraph_trace` |
| What breaks if I change Z? | `codegraph_impact` |
| Context for a feature or bug area | `codegraph_context` (`task`, not `query`) |
| Source for several related symbols | `codegraph_explore` (one call, not many `codegraph_node`) |
| Index health / pending sync | `codegraph_status` |

Use **grep/read** only for literal text (comments, strings, logs) or when CodeGraph shows a staleness banner for specific files.

### Required workflows

- **Before editing unfamiliar code:** `codegraph_context` for the task area, then one `codegraph_explore` for surfaced symbols.
- **Before refactors/renames/deletes:** `codegraph_search` → `codegraph_impact`; summarize blast radius before changing code.
- **For call flows:** `codegraph_trace` first — do not rebuild paths with search + callers chains.
- **Do not** use `codegraph_context` for **`.agent/SESSION.md`** or `/resume` — use **Read** + `.agents/workflows/resume.md`.
- **Do not** spawn explore sub-agents or grep-first symbol hunts when CodeGraph can answer in 2–3 calls.

### Index health (smart)

**Check before you init — never re-index by default.**

1. **Preflight:** Run `codegraph_status` at session start (or before your first structural query). Pass `projectPath: "<absolute-workspace-root>"` when MCP cwd may differ from the open workspace.
2. **Healthy index:** Proceed with `codegraph_*`. The file watcher auto-syncs edits within ~1–2s — **do not** run `init` after normal saves or successful queries.
3. **Staleness banner:** If a response starts with "⚠️ Some files referenced below were edited since the last index sync…", **Read only those listed files** for line-accurate content. Files not in the banner stay authoritative. Check `codegraph_status` **Pending sync** — wait for the watcher; do not init.
4. **Missing index only:** If MCP returns "not initialized" or `codegraph_status` confirms no `.codegraph/codegraph.db` under the workspace root, ask the user, then run once in the **workspace root**:
   ```bash
   npx @colbymchenry/codegraph init -i
   ```
   On large repos, confirm before a full init.
5. **Never do this:** Re-run `init` after every edit, failed search, or a few stale files; init from a subdirectory; init when **Pending sync** will clear on its own.
6. **Path fidelity:** Use the same absolute workspace root for `projectPath`, OntoSight `[project-path]`, and shell `cwd` when opening graphs — avoids indexing or querying the wrong tree.

## UI/UX skill (mandatory)

When this task involves UI (components, pages, layouts, styling, accessibility, design systems, landing pages), read and follow `.agents/skills/ui-ux-pro-max/SKILL.md` before acting. New UI: run `--design-system` search. Fixes/reviews: run targeted `--domain ux` or `--stack` searches. Verify the SKILL pre-delivery checklist before finishing.
